# iPartner
iPartner is a mobile application that provides information about plant protection products.
It allows users to browse a list of products, view detailed information about each product, including images, and perform searches.
The app utilizes a collection view for displaying the list of products and follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture pattern with a router for handling screen transitions.
The app also uses Auto Layout constraints for UI layout, URLSession for making network requests, and incorporates animations for enhanced user experience.
The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience.
